## Intro
有的时候我确实需要沟通一些*很难*的问题(通常是和关系很近的人)，但经常最后以
- 回避  
- 争吵  

其中的一种方式结束  
不管这个问题的是否得到了解决，确实会对我还有另一方造成挺不好的影响(短期:不良情绪，人际关系恶化; 长期:健康，其他subsequence...)  
如果你碰巧想要和我聊一些你觉得可能说起来很困难的事情，可以考虑看看下面的描述并且试着应用这个技巧  
我也挺想要尝试着练习一下这个技巧，当然把这个技巧写出来以一种好看的形式呈现出来并且让对方读一遍可能是其中重要的一步(逃  
这个技巧是我在读`亲密关系第8版`(这本偏心理学，不过没啥可以执行的技巧类的，reference区厚度超过1/4)  
的时候看到的觉得很有价值的一个东西吧，应用范围我觉得可以不止浪漫关系  
如果你也觉得这个技巧有道理，可以试试  
这个技巧的[中文翻译](#中文翻译)在下面，但是如果你是 English capable 的那就最好读英文版的，毕竟在以前甚至现在的中国文化里没有这个东西，使用英文会有助于理解  
## Technique
Try to follow the following rules when the discussion gets heated
#### Rules for Both of You
1. The Speaker has the floor. Use a real object, such as a book or TV remote control, 
as the floor. Whoever holds the floor is the only person who gets to say anything 
until he or she is done.
2. Share the floor. When you’re Speaker, don’t go on and on. 
Keep each turn brief, and switch roles often as the floor changes hands.
3. No problem solving. The point of the technique is to delineate a disagreement, not
to solve it. Collaborative brainstorming to solve the problem comes later.
#### Rules for the Speaker
4. Speak for yourself. Don’t try to be a mind reader. Use “I” statements to describe
your own thoughts, feelings, and concerns. Do not talk about your perceptions of
your partner’s motives or point of view.
5. Stop and let the Listener paraphrase. After a short time, stop and allow the Listener
to paraphrase what you’ve just said. If he or she is not quite accurate, politely
restate any points of confusion. The goal is to help the Listener really understand
you.
#### Rules for the Listener
6. Paraphrase what you hear. Show the Speaker that you are listening by repeating
back in your own words what you heard him or her say. The point is to make
sure that you understood what was said.
7. Focus on the Speaker’s message. Don’t rebut. You should not offer your thoughts
and opinions on the issue until you have the floor. Your job as Listener is to
speak only in the service of understanding your partner.
