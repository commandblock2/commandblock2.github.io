Inspired by ilmango, I stared play ATFC and got addicted.

## Intro

ATFC is a modpack with TFC(TerraFirmaCraft)(群峦) and Create(机械动力). It has some interesting balancing and integration between the mods, and it was kinda enjoyable.

## What about weekly series

Very unfortunately, they are stopped altogether with the self-hosted server, as I started playing `server2.autofc.com` and get to know may players, I stopped playing the old server with no other player logged-in in a month. I still have all the backups and save available, if anyone wants a copy, please contact me through matrix.
